# QR Code Generator With Blazor UI
Blazor WASM app to generate QR codes

Try it out: https://qrcode-blazor.azurewebsites.net/


Used Blazor WASM .Net Core Hosted because I wansted to use QRCoder to generate the QR code. However it was using System.Drwaing which is not supported in WASM on client side so I had to do the creation on the .Net server.
